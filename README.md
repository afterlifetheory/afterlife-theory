# Afterlife Theory

**Afterlife Theory** is a formal dimensional model proposing that consciousness undergoes a geometric transition at death:

- **0D:** Self-point (subjective identity)  
- **3D:** Out-of-body spatial awareness  
- **4D:** Post-mortem spacetime integration  

The framework integrates research from:  
- Consciousness studies  
- Near-death experiences (NDE)  
- Out-of-body experiences (OBE)  
- Information theory  
- Geometric dimensional models

## Purpose

This repository serves as the **canonical research archive** and formal development space for Afterlife Theory.  
It provides:  

- A **versioned record** of theoretical postulates  
- Publicly accessible documentation for the theory  
- A citable reference for independent or academic research
