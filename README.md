# Afterlife Theory

Afterlife Theory is a formal dimensional model proposing that consciousness undergoes a geometric transition at death:

- 0D: Self-point (subjective identity)
- 3D: Out-of-body spatial awareness
- 4D: Post-mortem spacetime integration

The theory integrates:
- Consciousness studies
- Near-death experiences (NDE)
- Out-of-body experiences (OBE)
- Information theory
- Geometric dimensional models
